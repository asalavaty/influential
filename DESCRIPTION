Description: Provides functions for classification and ranking of candidate
    features, reconstruction of networks from adjacency matrices and data
    frames, topological analysis, and calculation of centrality measures. The
    package includes the SIRIR model, which combines leave-one-out
    cross-validation with the conventional SIR model to rank vertex influence
    in an unsupervised manner. Additional functions support assessment of
    dependence and correlation between network centrality measures, as well as
    estimation of conditional probabilities of deviation from their
    corresponding means in opposite directions.
