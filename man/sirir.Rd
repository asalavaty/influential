\usage{
sirir(
  graph,
  vertices = V(graph),
  beta = 0.5,
  gamma = 1,
  no.sim = 100,
  ncores = "default",
  seed = 1234,
  loop_verbose = TRUE,
  node_verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A graph (network) of the igraph class.}

\item{vertices}{A vector of desired vertices, which could be obtained by the V function.}

\item{beta}{Non-negative scalar. The rate of infection of an individual that is susceptible
and has a single infected neighbor. The infection rate of a susceptible individual with n
infected neighbors is n times beta. Formally this is the rate parameter of an exponential
distribution.}

\item{gamma}{Positive scalar. The rate of recovery of an infected individual.
Formally, this is the rate parameter of an exponential distribution.}

\item{no.sim}{Integer scalar, the number of simulation runs to perform SIR model on the
original network as well as perturbed networks generated by leave-one-out technique.
You may choose a different no.sim based on the available memory on your system.}

\item{ncores}{Integer; the number of cores to be used for parallel processing. If ncores == "default" (default), the number of 
cores to be used will be the max(number of available cores) - 1. We recommend leaving ncores argument as is (ncores = "default").}

\item{seed}{A single value, interpreted as an integer to be used for random number generation.}

\item{loop_verbose}{Logical; whether the accomplishment of the evaluation of network nodes in each loop should be printed (default is TRUE).}

\item{node_verbose}{Logical; whether the process of Parallel Socket Cluster creation should be printed (default is FALSE).}
}
\value{
A two-column dataframe; a column containing the difference values of the original and
perturbed networks and a column containing node influence rankings
}
\description{
This function is achieved by the integration susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model
with the leave-one-out cross validation technique and ranks network nodes based on their
true universal influence. One of the applications of this function is the assessment of
performance of a novel algorithm in identification of network influential nodes by considering
the SIRIR ranks as the ground truth (gold standard).
