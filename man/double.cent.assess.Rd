\title{Assessment of innate features and associations of two network centrality measures (dependent and independent)}
\usage{
double.cent.assess(
  data,
  nodes.colname,
  dependent.colname,
  independent.colname,
  plot = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the values of two continuous variables and the name of
observations (nodes).}

\item{nodes.colname}{The character format (quoted) name of the column containing
the name of observations (nodes).}

\item{dependent.colname}{The character format (quoted) name of the column containing
the values of the dependent variable.}

\item{independent.colname}{The character format (quoted) name of the column containing
the values of the independent variable.}

\item{plot}{logical; FALSE (default) Plots quadrant means of NNS correlation analysis.}
}
\description{
This function assesses innate features and the association of two centrality measures
(or any two other continuous variables) from the aspect of distribution mode, dependence,
linearity, monotonicity, partial-moments based correlation, and conditional probability of
deviating from corresponding means in opposite direction. This function assumes one
variable as dependent and the other as independent for regression analyses. The non-linear nature of
the association of two centrality measures is evaluated based on generalized additive models (GAM).
The monotonicity of the association is evaluated based on comparing the squared coefficient of
Spearman correlation and R-squared of rank regression analysis.
Also, the correlation between two variables is assessed via non-linear non-parametric statistics (NNS).
For the conditional probability assessment, the independent variable is considered as the condition variable.
